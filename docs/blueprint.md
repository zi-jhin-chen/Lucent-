# **App Name**: Lucent

## Core Features:

- Style Insight Engine: Upload moodboards, outfits, post captures—get back soft-labeled visual clusters and thematic tags (e.g., earthy vs. bold, grounded vs. surreal)
- Identity–Expression Alignment: Mood-first questionnaire helps the system map where users’ current content may or may not reflect who they are becoming
- Seasonal Content Compass: Not a planner. A tone compass that nudges theme clusters (“early summer calm,” “deep energy,” etc.). Suggests soft-focus post structures for IG, X, and LinkedIn without rigidity
- Gentle Cadence Planner: An adaptive rhythm tracker: when user feels scattered or tired, it recalibrates suggestions
- Reflection & Growth Trail: Visual memory thread that shows how their tone and vibe have shifted over time—no likes, no numbers, just trace and pace
- AI Outfit Visualizer: Users can upload or link to a photo shared on social media. AI detects worn fashion items and provides soft semantic labels (e.g., "structured blazer," "minimalist loafers"). Users can then preview how these items might look on their own body through a neutral, non-gendered virtual model — rendered in their own proportions or an abstract silhouette. Emphasis is on overall styling tone, not body shape mimicry; meant to support curiosity, not comparison
- Subtle Merch Shelf: A collapsible bottom or side shelf UI, surfacing links to visually or semantically similar fashion items. Users can browse variations (e.g., by tone, material, silhouette) without disrupting their moodboard flow. Merch sources can include affiliate links, creator-curated drops, or AI-matched indie designers. Interface avoids hard sales — shelf is visually soft, with hover/expand logic, and context-aware recommendations
